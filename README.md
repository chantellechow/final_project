# Predicting churning customer at Interconnect


## Goals:

1. Predict churn

    - With high competition in the market, the marketing team would like to forecast potential churning customers in order to keep retention rate high. Once potential churning customers identified, they will be offered promotional codes and special plan options to try and retend the users.

    - Marketing team has collected clientele's personal data and our goal is to leverage existing client data to predict churn.<br><br/>

2. Client outflow research

    - Learning the behavior between churn vs active clients may help marketing and product teams to brainstorm better marketing campaigns and design better product plans.
    
        1. Compare monthly payment distribution between churned vs active
        2. Compare telephone and internet users 

This is a binary classification problem so will use supervised learning.
